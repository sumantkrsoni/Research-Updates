Weekly-Research Updates

## Date: 04 March 2025

## Accomplished Work

- The GNN code compilation and test result generation
- For Research paper "Graph network surrogate model for subsurface flow optimization, Haoyu Tang, Louis J. Durlofsky, 2024 ":
  - A thorough paper reading has been completed
  - PPT for key outcomes of the paper has been completed
  - Few related research papers are collected for the suggetions
 
- Other Academia-Related Work at SUAD:
    - The Course MTH-008 is almost going to be completed
  
## Pending Work

- The data analysis: Structure, Purpose, and their Interpretation of the supplied .h5 file in the code
- The GNN Code modification
- The JAX code implementation

## Difficulties faced 
- The GNN code has few syntax and method call issue that I am trying to fix
- However, it is the purpose-oriented approach which needs to be modified according to the new problem 

## Projected Plan for Next Week

- Going to read and analyze the GNN code for the collected simple research papers
- Need to conduct the exam on campus as well as the training session for the courses here



## Research Update for Meeting (25-04-2025)

- Updated the hyperparameters of GNN code to improve the accuracy of saturation
- Gone through the papers sent by Daniel
- Trying to improve the accuracy and Scale to the bigger dataset

## Projected plan for next meet:
- Writing my own code that executes the same task of encoding, processing and decoding for the reservoir data
- Improving the results of saturation of the GNN code
- Read and discuss the research problem in the relevant field.





# Meeting @ 09 May, 2025
## Research Update for Meeting (09-05-2025)

- The code for both model is showing better results (but it has no physics in it)
- The data has been modified but it seems the transmissibility has not been incorporated in the edge feature
- Also, tried the Inference stage but not separately. Now, working on the inference part for reservoir prediction separately

## Projected plan for next meet:
- Try to improve and analyze the code written so far by PhD Scholars
- Writing my own code that executes the same task of encoding, processing and decoding for the reservoir data
- Read and discuss the research problem in the relevant field.
