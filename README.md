## Accomplished Work

- The GNN code compilation and test result generation
- For Research paper "Graph network surrogate model for subsurface flow optimization, Haoyu Tang, Louis J. Durlofsky, 2024 ":
  - A thorough paper reading has been completed
  - PPT for key outcomes of the paper has been completed
  - Few related research papers are collected for the suggetions
 
- Other Academia-Related Work at SUAD:
    - The Course MTH-008 is almost going to be completed
  
## Pending Work

- The data analysis: Structure, Purpose, and their Interpretation of the supplied .h5 file in the code
- The GNN Code modification
- The JAX code implementation

## Difficulties faced 
- The GNN code has few syntax and method call issue that I am trying to fix
- However, it is the purpose-oriented approach which needs to be modified according to the new problem 

## Projected Plan for Next Week

- Going to read and analyze the GNN code for the collected simple research papers
- Need to conduct the exam on campus as well as the training session for the courses here
